## Earth's climate variability in different time scales

### 1,000,000 years

Reconstruction of the temperature from last million years shows periodic changes in Earth's climate. The 100,000 years cycle is visible. Long and colder periods when ice sheets are expanding are followed by shorter, warmer interglacial periods.

### 100,000 years

In the scale of last 100k years we see transition from last interglacial period, called Eemian, to roughly 100,000 year long cold conditions and back to warm period which is underway until now - the Holocene. 

 * Glacial period: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Glacial_Period
 * Previous interglacial period: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eemian
 * Current interglacial period: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene
 * Laurentide Ice Sheet: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurentide_Ice_Sheet
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Glacial_Maximum

We use various proxies for the climate reconstruction. They includes ice cores drilled from Antarctic and Greenland, but also fossil data, ocean sediments and others.

 * [Article] Reconstruction of Eemian climate from northern Finland https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05314-1

Data from Greenland ice cores show rapid temperature changes during last glacial period, in opposition to much more stable Antarctic record:

### 10,000 years

This time scale covers the Holocene. The transition from glacial period starts around 14,500 years before present with rapid warming event called Bølling–Allerød, interrupted by Younger Dryas period. The Holocene itself starts approximately 11,650 years BP.

### 100 years - industrial era and Global Warming

Over the past decades we see rapid change in climate conditions. The average temperature rose over one degree C on average, with much more growth in the northern latitudes, especially in the Arctic.
